          A new zero-day vulnerability in the Spring Core Java framework called &amp;lsquo;Spring4Shell&amp;rsquo; has been publicly disclosed, allowing unauthenticated remote code execution on applications.
Spring is a very popular application framework that allows software developers to quickly and easily develop Java applications with enterprise-level features. These applications can then be deployed on servers, such as Apache Tomcat, as stand-alone packages with all the required dependencies.
Today, an exploit for this zero-day vulnerability was briefly leaked and then removed but not before cybersecurity researchers could download the code.

          Introduction to ShellShock ShellShock Vulnerability [CVE-2014-6271], also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the Unix Bash shell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests.
Shellshock is a privilege escalation vulnerability that offers a way for users of a system to execute commands that should be unavailable to them.
