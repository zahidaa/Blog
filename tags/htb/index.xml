          Introduction to ShellShock ShellShock Vulnerability [CVE-2014-6271], also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the Unix Bash shell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests.
Shellshock is a privilege escalation vulnerability that offers a way for users of a system to execute commands that should be unavailable to them.

          Intro to Insecure deserialization Serialization is when an object in a programming language (say, a Java or PHP object) is converted into a format that can be stored or transferred. Whereas deserialization refers to the opposite: it‚Äôs when the serialized object is read from a file or the network and converted back into an object.
Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities happen when applications deserialize objects without proper sanitization. An attacker can then manipulate serialized objects to change the program‚Äôs flow.

          Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications‚Äîwhich may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll try to get remote code execution by exploiting MSSQL.
Enumeration Nmap Scan nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/archetype 10.
